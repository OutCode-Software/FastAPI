# FastAPI

This ReadMe file provides a brief overview of FastAPI, its features, and how it can be used to develop robust and high-performance web applications.

## Introduction

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and learn, and provides a range of features that make it ideal for developing both small and large scale applications. Some of the features that make FastAPI stand out are:

- **Fast**: It is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, with performance comparable to Node.js and Go, thanks to the asynchronous nature of the code and the use of the Starlette framework.

- **Easy to Use**: FastAPI is easy to learn and use, with a clean and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to build APIs.

- **Standards-based**: It is based on Python type hints and the OpenAPI standard, making it easy to integrate with other tools and frameworks.

- **Integrated**: It comes with integrated support for popular tools and libraries such as Pydantic, Tortoise ORM, Jinja2, and more.

Each of these tutorials covers a different aspect of FastAPI development, and together they provide a solid foundation for building high-quality APIs with FastAPI.

## Installation

To get started with FastAPI, you'll first need to install it on your system. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

```bash
pip install fastapi
```

This will install the latest version of FastAPI along with its dependencies.

## Running the Application

To run a FastAPI application, you'll need to create a Python file that defines your API endpoints and other settings. You can then run this file using the uvicorn server, which is included with FastAPI. Here's an example of a simple FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

Save the above code to a file named main.py, and then run it using the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the server and make your application available at http://localhost:8000.

## Conclusion

FastAPI is an excellent choice for developing high-performance web applications, particularly APIs. It is easy to learn and use, and provides a range of features that make it ideal for building robust and scalable applications.
